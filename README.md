# Udacity - MyReads: A Book Lending App
#### John Butler - React Fundamentals Project

### Installation:
 This application requires nodejs to be installed and running as well as npm.  It has been created using React's "create-react-app". Application installation is actually pretty simple. First clone the app from my github repository. Then in the root directory of the installation, run npm install to install all application dependencies. After that you can start the app by typing npm start from the command line.

 ### Overview:
MyReads connects to Udacity's book server. It allows the user to manage his book reading list with 3 main categories: Currently Reading, Want to Read and Read. You are able to move books from one category to another. There is also a search page that allows you to search for books. The search functionality sends a search to the server when you hit Enter from the search field. The search results remain on the search page until the search query is cleared. This allows you to navigate away from the search page and back without losing your search.
